# RBEMastersProject
A repository for the code which contributed to my masters project. Written in MatLab as an extension to the open source research software matRad, which can be found [here](https://e0404.github.io/matRad/). The majority of the modifications can be found in the VariableRBE folder. All code is written in collaboration with Daniel Hargreaves.
