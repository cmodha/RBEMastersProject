Version 2.10.0 "Blaise"
	Second Release of matRad. Note that despite major incompatibilities with "Alan" we still chose major version number "2" to have a consistent versioning in the future.
	we want to thank all new contributing authors (see AUTHORS.txt)
	The new release contains:
	- integration tests using TravisCI (with Octave, so no GUI functionalities are tested)
	- matRad_rc script to configure matRad paths
    - matRad version can now be printed with matRad_version, version correctly shown in GUI and when using matRad_rc
	- Seven new Matlab exmaple scripts to demonstrate use of matRad 
	- added basic interfaces to the open-source photon/proton MC engines ompMC/MCsquare
	- Overhaul of the optimization interface using OOP and integration of the fmincon optimizer from Mathworks' MATLAB Optimization toolbox
	- Changes to the cst variable (new script to convert old to new cst structures in tools folder)
	- separation of ct/optimization/dose calculation grids to allow different resolutions
	- The graphical user interface can now be started in developer mode (more error information) and a simplified educational mode (some functionalities disabled, less buttons)
	- base data and default phantoms now organized in subfolders
	- DICOM export added (only script, dicomImport folder renamed to dicom)
	- DICOM import GUI
	- binary import and export functionalities (script & GUI)
	- overhauled the standalone project file
	- standalone toolbox file for matRad
	- Dose calculation now uses generalized initialization scripts
	- matRad_compareDose tool to compare two dose distributions with difference and gamma analysis
	- more tools for visualisation and data analysis in the tools folder
	- Possibility to define range shifter
	- Quality indicator & DVH display wrapper scripts
	- wrapper to allow 3D conformal planning using dij collapsing
	- new colormap handling to allow integration of custom colormaps
	- modularization of slice display by dedicated functions in plotting folder including generation of 3D views
    - New global configuration object (matRad_cfg <- MatRad_Config.m) to store default values and with logging interface
	- many bug fixes and many new bugs..
